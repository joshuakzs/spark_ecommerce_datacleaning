# spark_ecommerce_datacleaning
Combine and clean 21 csv files (totaling 14-15MB) using PySpark on Databricks. This project is for me to learn and practise using Apache Spark. 
Data is taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oleksiimartusiuk/e-commerce-data-shein/data

I wrote PySpark code on a databricks notebook to do my data cleaning. I had to do a little of each of the following for the data:
* Columns Renaming
* Reformatting data
* Missing Data Imputation
* Dropping Redundant Columns
* Dealing with duplicates
* Feature Engineering
